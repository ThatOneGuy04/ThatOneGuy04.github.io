    <h1>The History</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Arcade machines are just coin operated machines programmed with games to play. Once the appropriate coin is dropped in the slot, the machine will let you play the game accordingly. It was as simple as that, which is why many people easily understood the concept of arcade gaming and loved it. The arcade gaming scene started out as early as the late 1930s with the first few coin operated pinball machines. As the decades came rushing in, games became better and better, and by the late 60s, arcade games started becoming more fun.</p>
